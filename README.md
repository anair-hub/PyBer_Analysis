  Fares are highest for urban areas, followed by  suburban and then rural areas. General trend is that there is a hike in fares during later part of Febrauary. There are fewer fluctuations for suburban areas as compared to urban and rural areas.

 ## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 


** Since Urban areas are the busiest, offer some discounts and schemes which will encourage more folks to use the rides facility. Also to encourage ride sharing.

** It is more important to provide schemes in suburban areas and a little more marketing to get folks to use the services
 
** In rural areas, more drivers are needed and more discounts to get people started on using these services on a regular basis
